Tacos To-Go Mexican Grill is a cheap and quick dining place for all the students and staff. They claim to be excellent in serving burritos, soft tacos and nachos, none of which I had ever tried earlier in life. So I decided to pay a visit to this place and explore, Tacos To-Go Mexican Grill have two outlets in the campus one in Poly Canyon Village and the other is next to library. Once you enter the restaurant it has such a nice vibe with peppy Mexican music on and colorful ambiance that one is sure to like this place.<br /></p><p>Tacos To-Go Mexican Grill has a variety of dishes on their menu card, I ordered for a chicken burrito. That costed me roughly 4 dollars. Moreover the person at the billing counter was very helpful and soft-spoken. He helped me in ordering, observing me being new to Mexican food he kind-of explained me their signature dishes in detail. Mexican food is very simple without much of embellishment, the order I placed was ready in 2 minutes and it was served hot. One should definitely check the hot sauce this place has with burrito, it really spices things up. Burrito is a wheat flour tortilla with a filling of your choice, in my case it was chicken, beans and veggies. <br /></p><p>My experience at Tacos To-Go Mexican Grill was further enhanced by a friend with whom I accidentally happen to meet there. He told me he is a regular customer of Tacos To-Go Mexican Grill and almost likes everything they produce. The quantity of burrito which I had taken was also very decent, one is good for one though. Post eating my burrito I had a word with the chef there and asked the recipe, she was really happy and explained me a lot of things. I believe I can make this dish at home now <img class="emoticon" alt="smile" title="smile" src="https://polylearn.calpoly.edu/AY_2016-2017/theme/image.php/cpclean/core/1474824982/s/smiley" />.<br /></p><p>Tacos To-Go Mexican Grill is a happening place in the evening, as a lot of students go there after their classes. Moreover the Polly Canyon Village Community center is right opposite to the restaurant which is why the location of this restaurant is spot on. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for cheap food and clean and decorated ambiance. Finally I would say that I will definitely visit this place again since I still need to try few other things on the menu which include tacos, pork rinds, and quesadillas.<br /></p></body></html>
