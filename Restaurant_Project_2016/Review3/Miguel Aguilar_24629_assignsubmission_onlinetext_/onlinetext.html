It has it's own tiny parking lot that usually gets filled since it's pretty popular, but there's parking on the nearby streets that is easy to find. The venue has an outside patio and the tables have an umbrella to block the sun. Inside is pretty spacious with plenty of tables, and it's split into a market and a deli shop. There are aisles filled with groceries and drinks and one can order a sandwich by the registers. For entertainment there are a couple of televisions for people to view and in the back there are pinball machines to play.<br /></p><p>They had a wide variety of sandwiches all with different ingredients ranging from hot and heated to freshly cold sandwiches. I ordered the fresh Tassajara Delite which had turkey, bacon, pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onion, and honey-jala sauce on sliced sourdough. It came split in two large halves that are pretty filling as a whole, but each half is great for a satisfying snack. The sandwich was delicious probably one of the better sandwiches I had in a while. It tasted like a fresh sandwich but most of the flavor came from the honey-jala sauce it had on, which gave it a sweet and spicy taste to it. They also have a variety of drinks, including beer, and other food since it's a market. The sandwich cost about $8.50 but well worth the quality of food.<br /></p><p>The service was very friendly. All the workers were happy to make the sandwiches and ready to have a conversation with you. The service was also relatively quick, it took less than 10 minutes for the sandwich to be brought out. They all spoke English as well, which made it easy to understand what they were saying. However, their operating hours end early because they close every day at 7pm except Sunday which they close at 6pm.<br /></p><p>Overall, Lincoln Market &amp; Deli is the place to enjoy a fresh sandwich. Getting there and parking isn't terrible so not much time is needed to be set aside. Inside there are plenty of seats to sit down, and it's also a market in case you have grocery needs (selection is limited), plus they have pinball machines for one's entertainment. The sandwiches are well worth their value and service is relatively quick. I recommend trying the Tassajara Delite if you do decide to come here.<br /></p></body></html>
