Located in the heart of downtown San Luis Obispo, on Higuera St, Urbane's exterior looks like nothing special: this venue could house any type of business. Despite its quality, Urbane could be classified as a fast food restaurant; service is fast, food must be ordered at the counter, and patrons must find their own seats.</p><p>Urbane serves exceptional food at reasonable prices. I ordered a cilantro chicken salad, which came in under 9.00, including tax. The salad was quite large (could easily be shared by two) and came with a slice of focaccia bread. The facaccia was incredible, soft and flavorful and still warm from the oven. The salad was excellent as well. The base was a mix of green lettuce and red cabbage, with corn, chicken, and mozzarella on top. I like green lettuce as a base for salads, and the cabbage offered a satisfying crunch which many salads unfortunately lack. The distribution of toppings to salad was even, making for flavorful bites. The chipotle ranch dressing tied the salad together without overpowering it. I enjoyed the meal, but some might find the menu at Urbane Cafe to be limiting. Its menu is not very expansive, and those who don't particulary like vegetables will be dissappointed.</p><p>Urbane's location is ideal: right in the heart of downtown. The venue itself is, however, nothing special. The decorations indicate that this is a chain restaurant, with logos across the exterior. The exterior is a plain beige color, and there really is only one entrance because the rear entrancce is blocked by the restaurant's recycling bins. Seating is plentiful, with options inside and out. The interior of the restaurant is clean and well-maintained. Parking can be hard to come by downtown (Urbane only has two spots in front of it), but there are two garages conveniently located on adjacent streets Marsh and Palm.</p><p>The service at Urbane is top-notch for what it is. There is no wait staff but rather employees behind the counter. Guests order their food and are assigned a buzzer, which will vibrate when the food is ready. Given this setup, the service is fantastic. The employee working the register greeted me with a smile and took my order no problem. The line moved fast as well, and it took me under ten minutes to get my food. Overall, Urbane Cafe is an excellent option for salad-lovers in downtown San Luis Obispo. Portion sizes represent tremendous value for the money, even if the menu is limited.<br /></p></body></html>
