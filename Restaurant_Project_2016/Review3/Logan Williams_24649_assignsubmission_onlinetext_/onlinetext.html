With delicious food, attentive service, and moderate prices, Fig Good Food is a good choice for a semiformal date or intimate meal for a few people.</p><p>One of the greatest things about Fig Good Food is there food (obviously?). Their menu consisted of a refreshing list of somewhat uncommon dishes, ranging from wholesome bowls and salads to sandwiches and fresh pasta. As one might expect from this type of restaurant, most of their meals were priced from $12-$17. Though not outrageously expensive, I would have felt much more satisfied if the prices were four or five dollars cheaper. I ordered a chimichurri roast beef sandwich, which consisted of rotisserie top sirloin, melted cheddar, chimichurri aioli, lettuce, tomato, and herbed focaccia (it also came with a mixed greens salad). The sandwich was perfect—all of the flavors and textures blended well and it was just the right amount of food. I was definitely pleased with the quality of the food.</p><p>Another good quality of the restaurant was their service. When we first walked into the restaurant, there was no one to greet us and we weren’t sure if we ordered at the counter or sat ourselves. However, the waiter came out from the kitchen and seated us fairly quickly. Throughout the meal, he was very friendly and professional in his service; we never felt underserved (this is probably due, at least in part, to the fact that there were only two other tables to serve).</p><p>The venue of the restaurant is its worst characteristic. It only had about 7 tables in a very small section of the front of the restaurant. This was fine when we went because we had enough room between us and the other customers. However, I could imagine that it would be uncomfortably crowded if the restaurant was full. Fortunately, take-out is their specialty (at least according to their website), so you have the freedom to eat elsewhere if you don’t like the venue. Overall, I was impressed with the food and service, but wished the venue was a little nicer and the price a little lower.  </p></body></html>
