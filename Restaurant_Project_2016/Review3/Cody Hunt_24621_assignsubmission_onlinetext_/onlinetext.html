There is a wide selection of different types of sandwiches, including the standard chips and sodas that would be expected. The ham, turkey, and provolone sandwich that I ordered was of middling quality. I have certainly had better, but it's not the worst I've ever tasted either.</p><p>The service was slightly sub-par. It seemed to take the employees a long while to make the sandwiches; it seemed that they didn't quite have a routine in place yet. The restaurant is quite new, and the employees seemed to not have been working long, so some of this is understandable. Hopefully some of these will clear up as Port of Subs is open for longer.</p><p>The restaurant atmosphere and decor was rather plain. It was not ugly or dirty, but did feel somewhat sterile. It reminded me of what a truck stop restaurant looks like. The theme and decorations were not particularly interesting.</p><p>Overall, Port of Subs is an average sub shop. Although there are better ones, it is certainly a fine place to grab a quick sandwich if you happen to be in the area.</p></body></html>
