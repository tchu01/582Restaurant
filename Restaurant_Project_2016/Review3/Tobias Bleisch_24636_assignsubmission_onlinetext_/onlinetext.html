It’s basically exactly what the name implies – a small Deli/sandwich shop on actual High Street in San Luis Obispo. </p><p>The location itself is kind of away from other shops out in the suburbs, which in itself is fine, but the venue was pretty small in my opinion. The place has a cute charm that way, I suppose, except it means less seating, which is important especially around lunchtime (when we went) because of the high amount of customers. The flow in that little place was the thing that I noticed didn’t work out too well at all… The entrance is essentially blocked by an orthogonal line of customers trying to pay for their sandwiches. Once you get past that, if you haven’t been there before, it’s definitely not easily recognizable that the cash register isn’t where the sandwich journey starts – that’s at a counter across the room (where you mark your choices on a piece of paper). If you’re able to figure that all out, there isn’t much room to stand around and wait for all your order, so you might be forced to wait outside. Basically, the whole flow to the Deli could be improved.</p><p>I ended up ordering a Nashville Club which is a sandwich with smoked turkey, black forest ham, bacon, smoked Cheddar, BBQ sauce, Ranch, and jalapeños on Toasted Sliced Sourdough. They also had an impressive selection of beers, but I settled for a coke instead. We found a seat outside without too much difficulty. The sandwich itself was good, tasted pretty fresh and whatnot. The jalepeños surprisingly worked with that kind of sandwhich, although there was kind of an excess of lettuce on the sandwich, so much so that it was hard to eat a single bite of the sandwich from top to bottom. It could have also used a bit more sauce, but that’s probably just a personal preference. It wasn’t quite what I was expecting after all of the hype that I had heard from this place. There’s actually another Deli in SLO, Lincoln, that I think I may like better. </p><p>There weren’t really servers, so the only interaction I had with staff was picking and paying for the sandwich, but they were still friendly and greeted me with a smile. Waiting for the sandwich didn’t take long at all, which I’m thankful for seeing as how there wasn’t much of a place to work. All in all, High Street Deli was a bit overrated, but still not too expensive and a nice place to have lunch. There did also look like some really good cheese and meats from the actual Deli portion that could be interesting.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
