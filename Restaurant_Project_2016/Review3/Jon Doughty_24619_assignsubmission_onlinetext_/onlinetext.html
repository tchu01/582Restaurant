Its situated in a</p><p>single story building on the corner of Higuera and Toro street.  The parking</p><p>lot is small, but there was some street parking available. </p><p><br /></p><p>The inside of the restaurant is rectangular shaped and has maybe a dozen</p><p>tables. There are also a few tables right outside. Upon entering, you can order</p><p>at the counter directly in front of you. One thing that caught my eye was a</p><p>large selection of drinks located to the right after coming through the front</p><p>door. I checked out the selection, and it consisted of a variety of drinks, but</p><p>mainly craft beers. They had a small selection of six-packs, but a good</p><p>selection of 22oz bombers. I had not tried many of the beers there, so I went</p><p>with a Ninkasi Tricerahops which is a double IPA.</p><p><br /></p><p>Back at the front counter, the menu choices are all above along with some</p><p>desserts and a few beers on tap. I decided to go with the Gyro Plate. It came</p><p>with a mixture of lamb and beef slices, some romaine lettuce with tomatoes,</p><p>hummus, a yogurt sauce, and pita bread. Both the meats were seasoned and tasted</p><p>delicious, although not particularly tender, they were very flavorful.  The</p><p>sides were all good as well, the tomatoes and salad were fresh and the pita was</p><p>still warm. I really liked the hummus and the yogurt sauce as well. They also</p><p>had a little bar with more sauces. I had some of the red one, although not sure</p><p>what it was, it had a good spice to it.</p><p><br /></p><p>The staff at Petra were all friendly and seemed to be in a good mood. They were</p><p>happy to answer my questions about various dishes. I ordered my food to-go and</p><p>they brought it out to me when it was ready. I ended up barely finishing the</p><p>whole meal, it was much more food than I had originally anticipated. For a</p><p>quick, fairly cheap meal, Petra is a great go-to spot and I plan to visit</p><p>again.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
