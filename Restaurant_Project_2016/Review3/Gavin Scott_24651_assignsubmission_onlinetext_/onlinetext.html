They serve a wide variety of coffees, as well as a variety of sandwiches. Their food is all good, as is their coffee; their breakfast bagel-sandwiches are particularly good, and taste much fresher than the average bagel place.</p><p><br /></p><p>The service is fairly average; the food is ready pretty quickly but not as quickly as you might expect a sandwich place to be. The staff is friendly though, and go out of their way to accommodate you and make you feel comfortable. They are also willing to make modifications to your order, allowing you to tweak it to best suit your individual tastes, and everyone I went with that asked for these changes were very happy with how the food came out. This shows that the staff takes care when making your food.</p><p><br /></p><p>The venue is very interesting; its a long, thin place going all the way through the building, with small outdoor patios with extra seating on either end of the building. Indoors there are a few tables, a very small bar, and some couches around a coffee table. The place is very heavily decorated with pop-culture references and art, which makes it a generally pleasant and interesting place to be because it gives you many things to look at. They also save space on the wall to showcase local artists and sell their art. It's a little small, but they manage to make it feel more cozy than cramped.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall it's a very good place to study or get a quick, healthy breakfast. Their sandwiches and flat-breads are also very good, and I've heard good things about their coffee selections as well. The only real problem is that the food is sometimes made slower than you'd expect for what it is, and some of the food is a little pricier than it should be.</p></body></html>
