Parking is easy to find as it is on the outskirts of downtown. I ordered two grilled salmon tacos. They were good - the ingredients were fresh, and the salmon was grilled well and tasted good with the lemon. The food quality was definately high. My only complaint would be that the quantity was somewhat small, but it was big enough for lunch.Â </p><p><br /></p><p>Splash has a system where the customer orders at the front. I found the staff to be cheerful, friendly, and helpful. The food was prepared relatively quickly and the staff were prompt and courteous. I don't have any complaints here.</p><p><br /></p><p>Splash Cafe had tables inside and tables outside. The tables outside were a good place to eat lunch - they were somewhat shaded but received sunlight and the tables were very sturdy. The space inside was adequate but more cramped. I preferred eating outside. Parking was easy to find - if it not in their parking lot, then in the residential streets nearby.</p><p><br /></p><p>Splash Cafe had good food and overally I'd say it was a good place to go for lunch. The portion size was small for me, but it was adequate for lunch. The staff was prompt and friendly and the venue is good. I would return to Splash Cafe, although next time I would want to try their well-known clam chowder bread bowl instead of the fish tacos.</p></body></html>
