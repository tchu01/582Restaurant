After many good things said, I decided to try it for myself. The restaurant serves mainly wraps and sandwiches, with one of their main entrees being a wrap with fries, steak, avocado, barbecue sauce and whatever else one might want on it. The wrap was delicious, and I have no complaints about how the taste or quantity of food. However, the cost was somewhat high, which I would not have expected from the atmosphere. That being said, they have a deal where every Thursday they serve wraps for half off, which in my opinion would definitely make it worth it.</p><p>The service was excellent. We were checked in on frequently, and waited very little for anything to be brought out - either requests or even our initial orders. On top of this, the servers were extremely polite and fun to talk to. I think the service might have been my favorite overall aspect of the restaurant.</p><p>Of course being in Pismo is already a step in the right direction in terms of venue. This was complemented by a nice outside eating area that is both lively and accommodating of if you would like to sit in the sun, the shade, or even covered from wind. However, I would not say the venue was perfect, as much of what I described could be found in most venues in Pismo or in Avila.</p><p>After taking all aspects into review, I would consider Hoagie's definitely one of the more enjoyable restaurants I have been to. They have their faults, yet I think they have much more positives attached to them. I would definitely go back and give them more of my business in the future.</p></body></html>
