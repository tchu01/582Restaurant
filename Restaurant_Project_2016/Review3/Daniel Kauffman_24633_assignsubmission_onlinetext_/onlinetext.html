This lack of awareness, it seems, was likely my subconscious trying to spare me the experience. I had the soup and sandwich, both of which were served to me in the most disappointing manifestations of those words possible. The soup was definitely of the canned variety, shamelessly shining that neon orange glow indicative of liquids filled with preservatives. The sandwich was framed between two small slices of bread, like a reject from a third grader's lunchbox. My wife had a salad with Italian dressing that she described as "very salty".</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">The service was fine. I think the waitstaff did their best given the number of customers present.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">The layout of Louisa's Place is rather odd; the dining room is quite long, with part of the kitchen down its center surrounded by counter space for customer seating. It kind of reminded me of a Japanese grill - except instead of getting to watch your meal be expertly prepared, you were forced to watch the waitstaff microwave soup. We were fortunate to get a booth given how few there were, which was surprising for a diner. The walls were adorned with faux nostalgia posters pretending to be from the 1950s (the bathroom ceiling was covered with them - like a Sistine Chapel of bad taste).</span></p><br /><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">Despite the convenient location of Louisa's Place, the high cost of such lazy food will cause me to continue ignoring its existence. The prices for drinks in particular were outrageous. I had orange juice and my wife had coffee and together our drinks were eight dollars. For that much money, we should have endured our thirst and gone to one of SLO's many hipster cafes; at least there we would get a complimentary over-inflation of our own self-worth.</span><br /><p></p></body></html>
