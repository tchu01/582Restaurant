But one day after class, a friend of mine was raving on and on about the salmon bisque and dragged me to Novo for a quick weekday lunch. I ordered the grilled albacore sandwich on ciabatta and a cup of the salmon bisque. Usually for sandwiches I would stick with poultry, but today I decided to try the fish. To be honest, the grilled albacore was delightful but the ciabatta was rough and since the sandwich was so elevated, I had to eat the thing with a fork and knife. The salmon bisque did live up to the hype though, but I wish I had more of it. Overall the seafood was delicious, everything else mediocre, and the price horrendous - I ended up paying over $20 for lunch, ripping a hole in my slim college student wallet.</p><p>The service was okay but a tad sluggish. The waiter didn't get to our table for about five minutes and took a while to fetch our bill. He also made a mistake while reciting the daily specials, but maybe he was new. At least he refilled my water when I needed it.</p><p>Since it was lunch time, we had no choice but to be seated at the outdoor patio. The place is dog-friendly, so I enjoyed admiring the cute pooches miserably laying by their owners' tables, yearning to dine with them. It was a beautiful day and I enjoyed the fresh air, but with any outdoor seating, there was the inevitable issue of pesky flies circling our table and landing on our food.</p><p>Overall, the food at Novo was pretty scrumptious (especially the salmon bisque) if I ignored the dry ciabatta, massive price tag, and the darn flies that danced around us. I hate paying $20 for lunch (plus no drink), especially if the portions don't do it justice. I don't know if I would go back since there are cheaper options downtown.</p></body></html>
