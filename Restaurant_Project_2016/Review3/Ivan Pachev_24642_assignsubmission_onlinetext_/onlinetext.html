Poke Chef is the only poke restaurant in San Luis Obispo and provides raw fish for a relatively affordable price. However, because it's seafood, it's still relatively expensive. I paid about thirteen dollars for my poke bowl. Poke Chef had good reviews on Yelp and seemed to be popular around campus, so I arrived with high expectations. </p><p><br /></p><p>The restaurant is very small and there is barely any seating. The only indoor seating available is bar seating and there are three small tables outside. Luckily for me, the restaurant was not crowded, and I got my food almost instantly. </p><p><br /></p><p>I ordered a medium size bowl consisting of a rice base, with salmon, ahi, and albacore as my protein selections. Interestingly, the fish seemed fresh and did not taste too fishy. My bowl was topped with a nice variety of vegetables including cucumber, edamame, ginger, jalapenos, and onions. I had some problems choosing the types of sauce to add, but the staff helped me figure out what type of sauce I wanted, and even provided me with samples of the sauces. The sauces I ended up choosing where miso, wasabi, and spicy mayo. The miso sauce was slightly sweet, but was subtle and did not overpower the poke bowl. The wasabi was unfortunately not very spicy and did not seem authentic. The spicy mayo was perhaps unnecessary because the taste slightly overwhelmed the entire bowl's taste.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, Poke Chef seems like a decent place to get relatively cheap, quick raw seafood, and I think it deserves another chance. It seems to be pretty popular, so going when it's less crowded is preferable, considering the restaurant is so small. </p></body></html>
