Despite this, the burrito I got managed to surprise me as the rice and beans indicated to come with the meal were actually inside the burrito as opposed to being on the side. The portion was very large and I was pleased with the price, but there was nothing anything amazing about the food.</p><p>Our service was actually fairly decent, though there were only maybe 10 people in for lunch at the time. The waitress was quite friendly, but once or twice when we needed more water it was tough to track her down as she was the only waitress.</p><p>The venue at Sabor A Mexico was extremely mediocre. The interior looked fairly outdated, but was by all means still very functional. There wasn't much that would indicate it was a mexican restaurant aside from the name and the sign outside, but it kinda felt like it fit with the place.</p><p>Overall I wouldn't consider Sabor A Mexico to be a great mexican restaurant, but it was conveniently located in Pismo Beach and was a more than fair price for moderate food. I wouldn't not go back in the future, but it wouldn't be a place I rush to go to or suggest.</p></body></html>
