Sizzlingogi has many different lunch and dinner options, such as all you can eat, combination dishes, and side dishes. The prices for the food is not exactly cheap but the all you can eat option can be one of the better choices to pick if you are in a large group that's hungry. Sizzlingogi has its own parking lot, making parking easier. Sizzlingogi is located in Santa Maria on Broadway.</p><p>The all you can eat option can range from $20 - $30, for each person, depending on the 'course'. The combination menu let's you choose from 3 to 5 items, which are between $46 and $75. The meat that you order from Sizzlingogi is all cooked by you, this includes food such as beef brisket, pork belly, and beef bulgogi. But not foods such as rice or their steamed eggs. The food is very good, depending on how good of a cook you are. The food is relatively easy to cook, you need a good eye to make check and make sure the food is not under or over cooked. Once the meat is cooked, it tastes really well. The all you can eat option is a very good choice to make since you can get as much food as your stomach can handle for about $20. The atmosphere is above average because the decor looks like it belongs there, as well as all of the sounds and smells of people cooking food. The service is average because there were some occassions where someone brought us food that we did not ask for. Also, the wait time to get food was longer than I thought it would be. However, the employees were very friendly and came by often to ask us if we wanted to order anything else. The overall experience is above average because of the good tasting food, nice atmosphere, and polite employees.</p><p>Sizzlingogi has its own parking lot. On the way to the restaurant, my GPS put me on a road opposite of the restaurant. I had to cross the street with traffic going in both directions. Needless to say, it took a while before there was an opening to cross. Sizzlingogi also has a bar that you can sit at if you do not feel like cooking your own food. Sizzlingogi is a great place to go in a group; it is easy for Sizzlingogi to split checks so everybody pays for what they eat. What kind of threw me off is that once we got our checks, we also had to put how much gratuity as well. Instead of just paying for the meal itself, then adding gratuity afterwards. </p></body></html>
