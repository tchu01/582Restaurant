I ordered the chicken sandwich, their cheapest main meal at $14, expecting a dry, chewy piece of chicken breast slapped between some bread. What I received was nothing short of brilliance. The chicken had a lightly crispy skin around it and was perfectly cooked, with the right amount of juices and moisture, unlike many chicken sandwiches I've ordered in the past. Around the chicken was a smattering of salad and greens, with a light, flavorful dressing that reminded me of Christmas in Germany (or Leavenworth, Washington, a Bavarian Village an hour or so north of Seattle). The bread was hearty and toasted just enough to get some char and crunch and to hold the sandwich together. One the side was a delicious little salad, lightly dressed in that spicy mustard stuff I normally put too much on bratwursts. It had just the perfect amount so that it wasn't spicy. The beer selection was good and what I would expect of a German beer establishment, but the beer I chose was an unfortunate blend of IPA and German style and the poor taste certainly isn't the fault of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">The service at Queen Anne Beerhall is acceptable. At first, I wasn't sure how to order food and found a strange, walk-up cash only sausage bar. Once I found the normal bar, the bartender presented me with two menus, one for food and another for beer. After ordering food and taking my card for the tab, the bartender asked where I'd be sitting. Food arrived about 10-15 minutes later. </p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Queen Anne Beerhall's venue is made of long bench seating in a large, tall building. There are a few seats outside, but I think it only amounted to a table or two. The restaurant is situated next to an "urban village" (a local corrected me on this), offering a decent amount of parking and a quiet, not-crowded exterior. When I went, there was a local guitarist playing some bluesy tunes. When asked if there is a wifi (so I could write this review) the waitress mentioned that the restaurant prefers that patrons "disconnect to reconnect," which is fine I guess, but I had a connection to a local Starbucks attwifi on my phone so all was good.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Queen Anne Beerhall is a fantastic place to get food and drink. The venue can serve a large amount of people very well with their bench seating. This place opened my eyes to how good a chicken sandwich could possibly be and made me appreciate this local staple of Seattle.</p></div></div><br /><p></p></body></html>
