It has a small parking lot that is shared with a couple other restaurants and so parking can get hectic. The food was decent but not spectacular. I ordered the beef shawarma wrap and although the beef was juicy and tasty, the overall meal felt like there was something missing. I wish that the price was a little cheaper since the food portioning was a little small and it was something relatively simple to make.</p><p>On the flip side, the service at the restaurant was great. The cashier gave some suggestions on popular items and helped me to pick my choice. In addition, the food came out within ten minutes of ordering. They had a complementary yogurt and sauce bar, which is definitely a plus.</p><p>In terms of the venue, Jaffa has a nice layout. They have a lot of open seating in a spacious area that could allow for large and small parties to dine comfortably. Also the kitchen can be seen from the tables, allowing customers to see and smell the aromas that make eating the food more enjoyable.</p><p>Overall, Jaffa Cafe was an average tasting choice with most of its perks in terms of service and venue. However, it would be hard to recommend others to try this restaurant due to the high prices. Â </p></body></html>
