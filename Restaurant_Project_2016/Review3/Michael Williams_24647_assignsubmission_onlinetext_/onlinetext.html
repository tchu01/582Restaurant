Their selection of hot dogs is fairly unique however their execution could be better. For example their "Philly Dog" is a beef hotdog with grilled onions, bell peppers, and melted cheese. However the result is a hotdog with some melted cheese with nearly raw onions and bell peppers lazily placed on top. However, their "Louisiana Hot Link" is an unexpected step up. It's a simple hotdog with nothing more than a hot link placed on a surpisingly large bun. At first glance the size of the bun seems quite ridiculous however it works exceptionally well with the spiciness of the hot link. The bun is fairly sweet and it complements the sausage very well. <br /><br />Service as Central Coasters is very mixed. One would imagine hot dogs to be a fairly quick process but waiting 15 to 20 minutes for a "Philly Dog" just seemed excessive. Their "Louisiana Hot Link" came out faster but overall Central Coasters is not a fast food truck by any means. They take their time which would be more justifiable if more care was put into their food.<br /><br />My experience eating at Central Coasters was at CalPoly nearly Dexter Lawn. A fairly standard venue for a food truck so nothing special in that regard. However, the food truck will sometimes play music which seems nice until they start calling out names for the food. It is played loud enough to make it very hard to hear whose name is being called. Being located next to Dexter Lawn is a nice though as it provides a wonderful place to eat in the afternoon.<br /><br />Overall Central Coasters isn't a fantastic food truck nor is it terrible. The hot dogs are a fair price at between $5 to $7 depending on how much is added but if you need food quickly I would recommend going somewhere else. Food trucks are a nice addition to the food options available at CalPoly but, like much of the food on campus, there isn't too much that's very special about.<br /></p></body></html>
