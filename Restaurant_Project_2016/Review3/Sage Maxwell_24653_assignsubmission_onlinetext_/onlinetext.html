It is best described as a pizza themed subway. You are able to build your pizza as it goes down a line of ingredients.</p><p><br /></p><p>The ingredients are great. As someone who is allergic to both gluten and eggs I was delighted to find out their gluten-free dough is also vegan. For the price of two dollars extra I can enjoy pizza again which is exciting. </p><p><br /></p><p>When asking for the allergen hand book the person wiped down every laminated page before giving to me. I thought it was a nice gesture in cause I was super allergic to anything. They don't get a 5 star rating because they misspelled my name. Shee is not Sage, though I can see why they would make this misspelling. Went back a second time because it was so tasty. They misspelled it again. This time they spelled it "Shage". Amazing</p><p><br /></p><p>Their outdoor seating is excellent. The seating although small is very comfortable. They have a nice little fake fire with cool fake gems, that 10 year old me would have definitely stolen a couple of. Overall this restaurant is very nice. The food quality is great, price is reasonable and everything feels new.</p></body></html>
