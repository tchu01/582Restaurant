The food isn't the cheapest, but it is fairly good. They also serve large portions, so you will probably end up with an extra meal, which helps to make up for the cost.</p><p><br /></p><p>The service at La Palapa is great. The waiters are quick to seat you as well as to serve you, so it makes for a nice place to stop for a lunch break.</p><p><br /></p><p>La Palapa is located at the Marigold Center, so there's plenty of available parking. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, and it isn't too noisy indoors.</p><p><br /></p><p>La Palapa is a great place to stop at for a lunch break for local business employees, but I probably wouldn't drive all the way out to Broad for it otherwise. The food was fairly cheap, and they served us quickly. Overall, I would say the place is a bit above average for local Mexican restaurants.</p></body></html>
