I ordered a veggie calzone </p><p>that was excellent. The mix of vegetables and cheese was a great combination.</p><p><br /></p><p>The service at Del's was good. The waiter got us extra bread when we asked.</p><p>He also refilled the water at a timely interval.</p><p><br /></p><p>The venue was located next to 101 in Pismo Beach. The views of the ocean were</p><p>excellent but only available from a few tables in the restaurant, this is why </p><p>the rating is not higher.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall Del's gives great Italian food at a fair price, in a pleasant</p><p>location. I would give Del's a shot if you're looking for a nice dinner.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
