The entrance road is a winding procession that circumnavigates the</p><p>retaurant to the small parking lot in the rear. The restaurant is housed in a</p><p>small white building with french doors and small fountains near the entrance.</p><p>Mistura serves mainly Peruvian cuisine with a large selection of seafood.</p><p><br /></p><p>Visiting for dinner, the interior of the restaurant was dimly lit with an</p><p>elongated seating area elevated over a lower bar area. When entering, on the</p><p>wall to the right is an intricate water fountain with the restaurant name and</p><p>logo which is a circle etched in stone with multiple rings. The tables are</p><p>arranged close together which made the room feel somewhat crowded.</p><p>Furthermore, the low ceilings made the restaurant was fairly loud at times</p><p>which was inconvenient. </p><p><br /></p><p>The menus at Mistura are interesting, consisting of several pages mounted to a</p><p>wood board with a worn bolt and wing nut. While an amusing design, the length</p><p>and size of the menu made it difficult to read. The menu itself contained</p><p>numerous appetizers both cold and hot, salads, and plenty of main courses. The</p><p>main courses included entire sections of seafood, meat/poultry, and pasta. For</p><p>an appetizer we ordered a seafood sampler which included calamari, white</p><p>seabass, ahi tuna, and king crab. The calamari was a perfect balance of crunchy</p><p>and tender, while the raw fish was so fresh it just melted in my mouth. Finally</p><p>the king crab was wrapped around potato with avocado on top which was</p><p>delicious. For a main course I ordered the lamb shank which was served with</p><p>golden yuca and Peruvian beans.  The lamb was so tender it fell off the bone</p><p>and paired with the beans really well. I had never eaten yuca before, it was</p><p>good but somewhat dry. </p><p><br /></p><p>One nice aspect was that they waived the corkage fee for a yelp check-in. The</p><p>appetizers and courses were priced in the range of $15-$35. I would definitely</p><p>visit the restaurant again.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
