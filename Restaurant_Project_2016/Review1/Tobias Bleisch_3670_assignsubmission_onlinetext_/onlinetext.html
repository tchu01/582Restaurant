They serve fresh market cuisine (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) in a very light and open area, with sort of a woodsy feel to it (best way I can describe it). I went around 1:30pm and my initial thought was that the service wasn’t going to be the best because, when we first got there, the four of us were standing at the front desk and were seemingly ignored while employees were busy bussing tables and carrying food around us. We were sort of in the way at that point, and it felt awkward to just be waiting around. However, after a table was cleared and someone came to give us a seat, every other aspect of the service was great! Our waitress was super friendly, asked if we had any questions on the menu, fetched us water, and checked up on us throughout the meal. I even requested a different water glass because mine had some little food pieces stuck to it, and the waitress was more than happy to fetch a new one for me.</p><p>They officially serve breakfast until 1pm, but the waitress still allowed us to order off of the breakfast menu. I normally always get French toast whenever I go out to brunch somewhere, but decided to get an omelette this time, specifically the Blue Cheese, Apples, and Bacon Omelette. The food took a reasonable amount of time to get there for four people ordering (maybe 20 minutes or so), but, to be honest, I wouldn’t have minded so much if it had taken longer because they gave us this plentiful basket of rolls, corn bread, and coffee cake! I tried some of the corn bread and coffee cake and it was delish, definitely held me over until the meal arrived.</p><p>The meal itself wasn’t exactly what I expected from reading the description, but it didn’t stop me from enjoying it. It was essentially a medium-sized omelette with caramelized apple slices inside, a slab of blue cheese on top, laid down on a blue cheese sauce with broken-up bacon bits on the side. The dish also came with a side, so I chose some fruit slices over the traditional potatoes. I had expected the dish itself to be a bigger portion, but after I got over my initial disappointment, I realized that the portion I got was exactly what I needed to be full without having leftovers, so I was actually happier in the end. I think it’s probably healthier anyway rather than just trying to eat so much at once. I would have preferred the bacon to have been mixed with the blue cheese sauce and placed inside the omelette itself and for the apple slices to be a bit smaller (it was hard to take smaller bites with such long apple slices), but it ended up still being ok, and I really did enjoy the dish. Eggs were cooked fine and the apples and cheese tasted great. </p><p>All in all, it was just a very relaxing experience being there! The ambiance was such that, once you’re seated, you didn’t really feel rushed at all and it was just a very bright and roomy place. I’m usually one to complain about prices, but I was ok with paying the $13 or so for my omelette considering the quality that we got, and the basket of pastries! I would most definitely go back to Big Sky and recommend it to others as well.</p></body></html>
