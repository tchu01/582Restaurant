This time when going, I ordered the Island Blast pizza. I did not particularly enjoy it, although this may be in part because I am not the biggest lover of spicy food. However, I do believe that having ham as the only meat on this particular pizza was a mistake, and the barbecue sauce was less than complimentary of the rest of the toppings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo;"><span></span><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo;"><span>Although the food was regrettable, the staff and bartender were accomodating in changing channels to the sports games my friends and I desired to watch. However, this was negated by the fact that every tap I used to pour beer spurted foam for half of the pour, and my requests for a repour were denied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo;"><span></span><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo;"><span>As far as the location and atmosphere of the restaurant, very little was left to be desired. The amount of TV's seemed almost perfect, with each one showing an actually different game, as opposed to some places where most TV's are only showing one game. The patrons were lively, and there was a good atmosphere for all of the relatively local games, such as the Niners, Chargers and Raiders. The only criticism I could make is that the venue is quite small, and finding seating is often difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo;"><br /></p><p style="margin-bottom:0px;font-size:11px;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo;">Overall, Blast and its accompanying food and drink experience was mediocre. There is plenty of potential for improvement in the future, especially in relation to their menu. That being said, they do support the build your own pizza option, which seems like it could yield better results. After all, it is pretty hard to be bad at making every type of pizza.<br /><span></span></p></body></html>
