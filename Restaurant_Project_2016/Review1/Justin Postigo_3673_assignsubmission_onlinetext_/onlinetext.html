Poke can be described as sushi that's been taken apart. Poke Chef is in an area where there are many other restaurants adjacent to it. Poke Chef is in a parking lot off of California Boulevard and Taft Street.<br /></p><p>The price is on the expensive side for what I was expecting. I ordered medium sized box which can have up to 3 proteins. The total cost turned out to $13.50. This, for me, is more expensive than what I hoped for. The food came in a container similar to how Chipotle does their food. However, the price of Chipotle is less expensive than Poke Chef. The food that I ordered consisted of white rice, salmon, spicy ahi tuna, shrimp, corn, green onion, edamame, lemon ginger sauce, and toppings that included crab meat salad, sesame seeds, and kimchi. Normally, I would not eat something with all of these different types of food. After I got my food, the white rice was cold and the salmon came in small chunks which I was not a fan of. The combination of all of the flavors really threw me off and it was pretty much my fault for getting all of those types of food and flavors. But overall, the food was semi-decent. The venue was below average because there were not that many seats to sit at. I ate outside and there only about 4 small tables which were almost all taken and they can only seat to about 2 people. I would come back to this restaurant but I would order something more simple and most likely get the food to-go.</p><p>Because Poke Chef does not have its own parking lot and it was very crowded. I had to park across Taft Street in another parking lot. Poke Chef is off of California Boulevard so there are many people coming from the highway to eat at Poke Chef or at one of the other restaurants surrounding it. Although San Luis Obispo does not have any other poke restaurants, I would have preferred to have sushi. <br /></p><p>Poke Chef is good for people who want to take their food to-go. It takes about 3 minutes for your order to be ready. Poke Chef is also next to BobaStop and a cinnamon rolls bakery. So after I was done with my food, I could treat myself to something sweet. Poke Chef was not super busy but I had to wait behind 3 or 4 people before I could order. Poke Chef isn't just limited to just sushi-related foods. Other menu items include chicken and shiitake mushrooms.</p></body></html>
