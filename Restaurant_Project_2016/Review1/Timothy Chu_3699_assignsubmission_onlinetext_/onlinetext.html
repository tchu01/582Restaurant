It is easily spotted and has two easy accesses to the parking lot. The portion size of the food was good enough to fill me up for dinner. In addition, the pricing was fair, ranging from seven to ten dollars for their entrees. However, one complaint about the food was the proportions seemed a little off. The burrito had little chicken and more than average guac. The tortilla soup also came with more tortilla than soup. Although the proportions were off, the quality of the food was still decent, given that it was a relatively cheap meal.</p><p>The service at Rio Adobe Southwest Cafe was great. I ordered my food and was invited to sit wherever I pleased. They promptly brought out free chips and told me that the salsa bar was open. The food came within ten minutes and it was definitely fresh and hot.</p><p>The venue was very homely. The spacing between the tables was a little cramped, but they did have a variety of tables to accomodate for different party sizes. They also had nice window seats. They could possibly make it better by trying to keep the flies out, since there were a couple of flies buzzing around which annoyed me.</p><p>Overall, this restaurant was a decent dinner choice. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an affordable and filling meal. The atmosphere is welcoming, and I wouldn't mind trying it again.</p></body></html>
