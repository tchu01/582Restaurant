The food is what you would normally expect from a pizza place but is a little pricey for the quality. The alcohol menu was a bit larger than you would find at your average pizza place and was priced normally.</p><p>Â The service at Old Chicago was pretty good. We got seated right away and had our drink order taken quickly after. Our server always had a smile and seemed to really like working there. He frequently came by to check on our table and made sure we always had drinks and whatever we needed. <br /></p><p>The venue was below average because even though outside was absolutely freezing the second we entered it felt like going into a sauna. It was pretty clean and there was no dust or anything but the heat kind of drained your energy. The bathroom stalls, although clean, would not lock which made using them extremely awkward.</p><p>Old Chicago is a great place to go if you're walking around downtown Boise late at night and want some interesting food. Not only do they have pizza but they have varying types of pastas and wings. It is great because it stays open late, has a good variety of food and drinks, and the staff is very kind. <br /></p></body></html>
