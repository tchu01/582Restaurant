Upon asking the waitress what items were vegetarian, I was given the response - perhaps for the first time in any Californian restaurant - "Pretty much nothing", condemning me to spend the evening nibbling on an uninspired and over-priced appetizer. My wife and her friend - neither of whom are vegetarian - were similarly unenthused with the rather expensive yet bland and unappetizing meals served to them. I was also very surprised that the kitchen was unable to substitute refried beans with any other type; apparently we should have gone to Tacos-To-Go.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">Our server made no effort to collaborate with the kitchen staff to make a suitable vegetarian dish. In addition to having to maneuver around the complete absence of such entrees, I was compelled - for the first time in years - to track down our waitress and ask how much longer until we would be served. Although there were several other tables and the service team appeared understaffed, we felt that we were being made to wait an unacceptable amount of time and no effort was made on the staff's part to update us on our order.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">La Vida Roca is located on the second floor of a building along the Morro Bay waterfront, just above Rose's Bar and Grill (which I highly recommend). The decor - various sea creatures such as jellyfish dangling from the ceiling - looked like something salvaged from the entryway of a defunct aquarium. The view, however, was spectacular; it is difficult to ruin the experience of dining along the waterfront. Mariachi music played distantly on the speakers, as if to remind customers that this establishment was indeed a Mexican restaurant.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">Given the low quality and weak presentation of the food, as well as the slow and dispassionate service, the prices at this restaurant were far too high. Furthermore, given its location in a Californian seaside town surrounded by seafood restaurants with vegetarian options, it is surprising that this restaurant makes no attempt to serve people with common dietary restrictions. Instead of spending twelve dollars on the Mexican equivalent of a grilled cheese sandwich, I would have rather made a quesadilla at home and paired it with a twelve-dollar bottle of champagne to celebrate not having chosen to eat at La Vida Roca.</span></p><p></p></body></html>
