The store I visited is located in Northridge just around Chatsworth where I worked this summer. A coworker and I ended up frequenting this location. The inside of the restaurant looked standard compared to picture of other CPKs. The location surrounding the restaurant is decent.Â </p><p>Our service was great the first time we visted, and great every other time as well. Although it took a while to be seated, this is because the store was always pretty full. The servers were very polite and offered great alternatives for items they did not serve.</p><p>Before visiting this location, I was not a fan of CPK. I had been once before when I was younger and complained that the pizza didn't taste like other pizza (obviously not, every place's pizza tastes different, but I was under the impression that pizza was exactly what Pizza Hut made). This visit changed my opinion completely. The pizza was much better than I remembered. I ordered the pepperonni, which comes with oregano. I quickly realized this must have been what caused me to dislike the food when I was younger.</p><p>I have to say I really enjoyed the pizza and service. I have added a new location to my list of possible dining options. Hopefully other locations will have the same quality of food and service.</p></body></html>
