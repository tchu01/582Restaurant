I ordered a burrata cheese and heirloom tomato salad for lunch plus a pale ale. Growing up with mild lactose intolerance, I usually avoid anything with a heavy emphasis on cheese. In addition, I never had burrata cheese so I wasn't sure what to expect. The salad was surprisingly delicious -- the light and creamy burrata cheese in harmony with the fresh heirloom tomatoes, crisp arugula, and tangy balsamic glaze made for a refreshing entree for a scorchingly hot day. As for the beer, I'm not a big beer drinker so I don't normally order it, but the lightness of the pale ale with the notes of grapefruit paired well with my meal and made me satisfied with my choice. My only complaint is that although delicious, the salad was $12 and seemed simple enough for me to replicate at home.</p><p>Our waiter was friendly yet efficient; she didn't linger around but was accessible whenever we needed her (It's a pet peeve of mine when waiters are overly attentive). My friend and I were seated immediately and well taken care of.</p><p>For most of last year, SLO Brew was closed with plans to move to Higuera St. Now being right across from Blast 825 Taproom and Mother's Tavern, the new location is at the heart of the bar scene downtown and is definitely more visible to downtown dwellers from the street. Walking in, I immediately noticed the spaciousness. The restaurant has a sense of roominess that contributes towards the comfortable lunch atmosphere.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed my lunch at SLO Brew and am excited for their renovation. The food was well-crafted, drinks aplenty, and service was nothing to complain about. I can see myself coming back another time for dinner or drinks with friends. </p></body></html>
