Parking is a bit of a hassle and scarce because downtown is usually crowded and there are not many available parking spaces nearby. The restaurant is a hole in the wall but deceivingly has plenty of space and tables inside to fit many groups. It also has an outside patio in case one is in the mood to eat outside in the fresh air. The inside is maintained at a pleasantly cool temperature with low lighting and is decorated with nice portraits hanging by each table. Also, there's plenty of traditional hindu decor placed throughout the restaurant. Music is played softly in the restaurant to give it an accommodating atmosphere while one awaits their food. However, one can hear the sound of dishes being cleaned and other kitchen noises over the sound of the music if sitting to close to the kitchen, which can be a bit distracting. They also operate at interesting times from: 11:30am-3:00pm and 5:00pm-9:30pm.</p><p>I ordered the Pad See Ew, mild in spiciness, which is a stir fried noodle dish that is commonly eaten in Thailand. The entree came with the noodles, sliced carrots, and steamed broccoli. The noodles were large and wide compared to the typical size of noodles that come in ramen. They were also layered with some sauce that gave it a slightly sweet but spicy taste to it. The plate came out steaming hot and had to wait a good two minutes for it to cool down enough to be eaten. It was about $11 in total but well worth it because of the ratio of quality food per dollar, it definitely filled me up and left me satisfied. Also, the menu had variety of other food options ranging from soups to rice to noodle dishes.<br /></p><p>The service provided by the restaurant and its employees was excellent. The employees were all courteous and easily approachable. They provided water in the meantime while waiting for the food to be brought out, and checked-in minimally to see if you were enjoying your food which was nice because you can appreciate your food in peace. Food was prepared pretty quickly by the cooks, only took about 10 minutes or so. They also have take-out services where you can buy it to go or place a phone order to just pick-up. The only issue with the service was the strong accent that the workers had because it was difficult to understand what they were asking.<br /></p><p>Overall, Thai Classic is a great place to enjoy some nice quality thai food at a decent cost. The venue has a pleasant atmosphere and plenty of space to sit down and eat, but at the cost of your personal time because it takes a while to get there and place an order. However, the food does come out relatively fast and you won't need to wait to find seating because it's never too full. The service is very friendly but if you have a hard time understanding someone with a heavy accent then it might be a bit troublesome. Also, I definitely recommend the Pad See Ew if you decide to eat at this restaurant because it was delicious, and I heard that the thai tea accompanies the plate well.</p></body></html>
