I initially went there enticed by their 50% discount on orders of $15 or more, expecting mediocre though satisfying sushi. Such a deal reminded me of Aisuru's half-priced roll deal, which offers 50% of a selection of rolls, through nowhere as many as Sushiya.<br /><br />Upon arriving at the restaurant my party was seated within five minutes. Within a few minutes of seating a waiter took our drink order, being both polite, direct, and responsive, avoiding conversation while answering our questions. After giving us 15 minutes to look over the menu our main waiter came to us to take our order, also being prompt and direct, though a bit forceful for my tastes. The time waiting for our order allowed me to take note of the conflicting motifs in Sushiya's ambiance. Parts of the ceiling protrude from above, painted to exaggerate the corners and angles of the protrusions, seemingly an attempt to create straight orderly lines. The tables, dividers, and chairs add to this angular motif, all very boxy and rectangular. Angular designs like this tend to portray order through its minimalism and simplicity. Sadly, Sushiya's attempt at minimalism stands in stark contrast to the noise created by the restaurant's decorations. The ceiling is scattered with lights, sprinklers, fan ducts, and security cameras. Odd plants atop the dividers, with various kitsch on the walls, including a banner of grayscale stock imagery nudging against the ceiling. Luckily, Sushiya offers a large flat-screen television looking out over the main section of the dining room, projecting a sports game. While this offers some distraction from their cumbersome insertion, I found it grossly insufficient. <br /><br />The food itself arrived between 20 and 35 minutes after our order was taken. While I was fine with the time it took for our food to arrive, the time between the first and last dish annoyed me, leaving myself and those in my party to wait with food in front of us, waiting for everyone to be served. I ordered the Super Dragon Roll and the Super Spider Roll, both an amalgam of crab, cucumber, avocado, and shrimp, among other things; bombastically maximalist, especially compared the minimalistic stylings of traditional sushi, or even the simplicity of the half-price rolls at Aisuru. The flavors of everything in the sushi mixed together into a sweet yet savory taste. While most sushi offers a complex flavor profile open to much subtlety, I found the sushi I ordered to be noisy on the tongue, all blending into a monotone of flavor, with an assortment of soft and crunchy textures. <br /><br />Overall I found Sushiya to be a decent restaurant, given the very low price point. After a few drinks to lower expectations, I think that the dining experience here would be decent, perhaps even enjoyable. Go here not expecting good sushi, but rather a hodgepodge of rich seafood wrapped in rice and a sheet of nori. It's tasty, but to call it sushi would be like calling a bearclaw a croissant. I'd go here if Firestone is a favorite, but you need to mix it up a bit.<br /></p></body></html>
