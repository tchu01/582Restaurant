The food not terribly cheap, at about $10.50 for a lamb shawarma, however the serving size helps to make up for the cost. My only complaint about the food is that it is pretty greasy, but otherwise, it is very decent.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a small casual dining restaurant, Jaffa Cafe doesn't offer much in terms of service. That being said, they are quick and the tables are kept very clean, earning it an above average rating for what is offered.</p><p><br /></p><p>The restaurant is located close to downtown San Luis Obispo, so there is a small parking lot available, although not a large lot considering how many restaurants are in the surrounding area. The inside of the restaurant is plain, but kept very clean with plenty of inside seating. Being a part of The Mix, there is plenty of outside seating available along Monterey as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a whole, Jaffa Caffe is a good restaurant for anyone in a hurry, or looking for a quick fix for Mediterranean food. The food is relatively cheap, at around $10 per item on the menu, but the serving sizes make up for the cost. Located just down the street from downtown San Luis Obispo, Jaffa Caffe is in a great location, but often suffers from a lack of parking.</p></body></html>
