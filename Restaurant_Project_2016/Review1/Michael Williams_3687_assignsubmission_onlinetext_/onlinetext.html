From waffles and pancakes to eggs and sausage, Goldy's has it. While at Goldy's I ordered their chicken fried steak and eggs with a side of their famous "Peps"; Red potatoes with grilled onions, bell peppers, cheese, and Goldy's special seasoning. The food was outstanding. The chicken fried steak had a uniquely crisp breading and was complemented well with their fantastic gravy. My eggs were cooked exactly to order and were much better than most I've had at other diners. They didn't have that odd and difficult to describe fakeness that eggs at other, cheaper, diners seem to always have. Lastly the "Peps" were absolutely delicious and competed with the chicken friend steak as the star of the dish.<br /><br />The service at Goldy's was overall good. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server took our drink order promptly but it took an oddly long amount of time to fulfill it despite its simplicity. Just a glass of ice water and some hot black tea. Our food order was taken as we got our drinks and our food came out reasonably quickly. However, once served our food I would have preferred a bit more attentiveness, specifically in regards to water refills and getting our check. That being said I wouldn't say Goldy's has poor service at all, there is just some room for improvement.<br /><br />Goldy's Breakfast Bistro is quite small but charming. It is located right in the heart of Boise and, despite being a breakfast place, appears to be busy nearly all day. From the outside Goldy's gives off a "Hole in the Wall" vibe but once you walk inside it becomes immediately welcoming and homey. The walls are covered in all sorts of memorabilia but manages to avoid that tacky diner look. Goldy's is definitely a nice, calm, and comfy place to get breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Overall Goldy's is a wonderful restaurant and a great way to start the day. The food is exceptional and venue is very welcoming. My only complaints are very minor. The service could use small improvements and the amount of food on my plate was more than I really like. I'd much rather get less food that I'll actually eat and save a buck or two than get a plate piled high that I'll have to box up and take with me. However, these small complaints don't take away from the fact that Goldy's is perhaps one of the best breakfast diner's I've been to in a long time. Goldy's manages to do so much right that it has become quite the memorable place for me.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
