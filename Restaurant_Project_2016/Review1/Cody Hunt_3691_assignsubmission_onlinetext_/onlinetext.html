There are Â both burgers and sandwiches available, with alternate meats available for those who would prefer white meat or vegetarian meals. The food is good, even if the options seem a tad limited. The price is about right for the amount of food that is served, although it is not a cheap restaurant.</p><p>The service is good, about what would be expected from such a diner experience. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food came in a reasonable amount of time, although I only ordered for one person. The payment is done at the cash register, like other diner-style restaurants.</p><p>Margie's Diner presents a classic diner experience, like restaurants such as Richie's or Denny's. However, Margie's feels more authentic then some of the chain diners. Everything from the decor, the food, and the size of the diner contributes to a classic Americana atmosphere, without seeming like it is trying to hard to feel retro. The restaurant is designed in a one-row style with a bar. The food is very American, including lots of classic breakfast options.</p><p>Overall, Margie's is a very good choice for a classic diner meal. It is located on Calle Joaquin, off of Los Osos Valley Road. It is a bit out of the way, but very convenient if you happen to be staying in one of the several nearby hotels. The food is good, the service is helpful, and the atmosphere is cozy.</p></body></html>
