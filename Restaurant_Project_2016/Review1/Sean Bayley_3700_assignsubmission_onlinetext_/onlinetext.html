It came with a side salad and bread. The meat lasagne itself was probably the best lasagne I've had in years. I had plenty of leftovers so it could easily be a meal for two. The only reason I rated the food 4 was because the salad and bread were sort of mediocre. I ordered the greek salad, and although it was tasty, it was pretty basic.</p><p>The service was exceptional. Our waitress was a nice young gal who quickly seated us and brought us our beverages. She remained spot on throughout the course of the meal. It's a small place and there were only a few other groups besides us -- but still, she was on point.</p><p>The venue is a little quirky. I enjoyed the "no frills" style, but it's definitely not the place to take someone you're trying to impress. It's also pretty small. I would imagine that when it gets crowded, it'd be pretty hard to hold a conversation. That being said, if you're just looking for a quick bite to eat, the venue should not be a deterrent.</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed Nucci's pizza. My meat lasagne dinner cost ~$15 dollars, which is a pretty good deal given how filling it is and the fact you get salad and bread. They had a limited beer selection, but I was able to find something I liked. If I were to go back again, I'd probably order the meat lasagne a la carte and take it to go. </p></body></html>
