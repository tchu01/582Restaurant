As one of the only seafood places in the area, they serve prepared meals and sell fresh fish by the pound. The restaurant is in a small building, with dining tables both inside and outside on a medium sized patio. </p><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality compared to the price. I ordered a calamari sandwich and my wife got fish and chips, each with a price of $10. Both meals also came with a generous helping of a mix of sweet potato fries and regular french fries. Overall, I enjoyed my meal—I thought the sandwich had great flavor, though I don’t have much to compare to because I don’t remember ever having a calamari sandwich before. I definitely felt like I got a great deal for my money since, to me, it seemed like a meal one would typically pay at least $12 for. Plus, it’s always a good thing when you leave a restaurant full and satisfied. </p><p>Pier 46 is a fast casual restaurant—you order at the register and seat yourself. The food was brought to us by a server, but other than that, they did not wait on us. At the end of our meal, we cleared our plates and left them in the dirty dishes bin on top of the trash can. Though the restaurant/market was very busy, the service we received was friendly and timely. We didn’t have to wait long for our food and I interrupted a server to ask for a to-go box and he didn’t hesitate to get one for me. Overall, the service at Pier 46 was good, though limited. </p><p>Pier 46 has the feel of being a good quality seafood place without any extra frills or fanciness. The interior of the restaurant definitely has a bustling market type of feel to it—I had to squeeze my way past some other customers, trying to find where the ordering line actually started. I doubt you would be able to easily have a conversation with someone with all the noise. However, the overall atmosphere made me feel like I had stepped into an entirely new place, so the change was a pleasant surprise. Although there were several tables inside, my wife and I decided to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather. They have a decent sized patio and we had no trouble finding a table when we got there (you have to sit yourself), though when we were leaving there were parties waiting for tables to open up. The two things that weren’t so great about the patio was the traffic (the patio is adjacent to a busy parking lot) and the chemical fumes wafting from the open nail salon next door. Overall, if you are looking for quality seafood for a good price and don't mind waiting in line or sitting in a crowded dining area (you can get food for takeout, though), I would recommend Pier 46 Seafood.</p></body></html>
