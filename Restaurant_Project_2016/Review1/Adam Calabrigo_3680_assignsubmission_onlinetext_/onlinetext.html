Upon arriving, one notices that the restaurant resembles a stand: all seating is outside. Parking is limited, and the location is less than ideal due to the limited seating.</p><p>Fattoush features reasonably priced food; however, the quality is lacking. While the gyro meat offers rich flavors, much of it is overcooked and tough. The falafel lacks adequate seasoning, becoming a chore to eat due to plain flavors. The hummus offers a strange sourness, not usually characteristic of hummus. These complaints pale in comparison to this reviewer's gripes with Fattoush's pita bread. Quite simply, the pita at this establishment is subpar compared to San Luis Obispo's other Mediterranean eateries: tough and chewy rather than soft and fluffy. For exceptional Mediterranean food, look elsewhere.</p><p>Fattoush offers a limited, yet charming, setting. The exterior seating is an eclectic mix of chairs and sofas - the kind of environment one might encounter in a student house off campus - lit with track lighting. Strangely, the atmosphere reads as Latin American rather than Mediterranean. The presence of a Shell gas station mere feet away detracts from the atmosphere, while the restaurant itself is a small building, resembling a burger shack.</p><p>Service at Fattoush is a mixed bag. The staff is friendly, but the response time is slow. Additionally, the employee working the register seemed disinterested and had to be bothered to provide utensils. The food also took a while to reach the table. Overall, Fattoush may cater to some lovers of Mediterranean food, but its style did not suite this reviewer.<br /></p></body></html>
