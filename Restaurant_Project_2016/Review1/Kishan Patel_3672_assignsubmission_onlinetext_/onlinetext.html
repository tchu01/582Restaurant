There is limited parking in the lot, but there is another parking lot across the street that customers can use. The restaraunt primarily serves poke - a type of Hawaiian fish salad. It is constructed in a kind of assembly line where the customer orders ingredients and the server puts them in a bowl and mixes ingredients. The server I spoke to described it as "Chipotle for deconstruted sushi". The customer orders a base, protein, toppings, sauce, and add-ons. The poke I ordered contained brown rice, chicken, crab salad, ginger, wasabi, and a few other ingredients. I found the ingredients to be fresh and flavorful. However I thought the price of about fourteen dollars did not justify small amount of labor involved and lack of structure. The protein and toppings are simply mixed together and added on the rice. This causes a problem because you have to get through this part (the bulk of what you pay for) after which you get to the rice. So by the end you have a lot of rice with only a few real ingredients.</p><p><br /></p><p>The staff was very nice. They were very accomodating to the fact that I did not know what poke was and explained the ordering process to me. However, they also gave me brown rice when I had ordered white rice so I have to dock them for that.</p><p><br /></p><p>I did not like the venue for a number of reasons. First of all, the location has few parking spots near by. Additionally the restaurant itself is very small. The worst thing about the venue is the fact that they only have a couple of very small cafe tables. It was difficult and uncomfortable to eat with two other people on the table we used. The price point is too high to justify this kind of seating.</p><p><br /></p><p>In terms of food Poke Chef is decent, but is overpriced because while the ingredients are of high quality there isn't much skill involved compared to something like sushi. The staff was nice and helpful but did make a mistake on the base I ordered. The venue of the restaraunt leaves much to be desired - more space in the restaurant and more parking would be nice. Overall I would give the restaraunt an average rating. I might recommend it to someone to try, but personally I will not be returning to Poke Chef any time soon.</p></body></html>
