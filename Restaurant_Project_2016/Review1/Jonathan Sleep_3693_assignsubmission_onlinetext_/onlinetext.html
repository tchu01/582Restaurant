To place an order, you have to fill out a form and hand it to the chef(s), as you would at a sandwich deli. My girlfriend and I ordered the lamb kabob and the pita pizza for sharing. I wasn't a huge fan of either dish. The lamb was a little bland. Usually lamb from Mediterranean restaurants taste more interesting because of the different spices used to prepare it but I couldn't taste much, if any, spices with it. The kabob came with lettuce and some grilled vegetables that helped fill my nutritional quota, but weren't too interesting taste-wise. To deal with the lack of flavor I dipped the lamb and vegetables in two of their sauces, but there were no labels at the sauce bar, so I had to guess which would be too mild or too hot for me. The pita pizza was just a fresh pita with some melted cheese on top. While the pita was really good - I felt that it didn’t really deserve being called a pizza - especially compared to Petra’s pizzas, which come from another Mediterranean/pizza place in town.</p><p>The food came out to us between 5 and 10 minutes after ordering. Service was friendly when ordering, but I didn't get the pita with my lamb kabob plate as was mentioned by the menu.<br /></p><p>The restaurant venue was sufficient for me. There was enough seating for us not having to stress out about where we would sit (unlike Raku Ramen next door.) There were both ample amounts of indoor and outdoor seating, and we chose to sit outside because it was a great temperature outside. The tables are placed right next to the sidewalk so people who pass by, are right next to you.<br /></p><p>Overall, the experience was OK. It is definitely not my first choice for Mediterranean food in San Luis Obispo, but the restaurant is located in between two others - which would allow me to choose from a variety of dishes if we return to the location.</p></body></html>
