The food is not particularly expensive, costing about ten dollars for a meal. Okimomo also serves a variety of Asian-style drinks as well as local wines. </p><p><br /></p><p>Prior to visiting Okimomo, I had high expectations of the restaurant, as it had a four star rating on Yelp. Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised that the parking lot was not particularly crowded, and I was able to find a shady parking pot directly in front of Okimomo. Outside, it smelled extremely appetizing, but it turned out that the smell was emanating from the adjacent restaurant, Rib Line. Walking into Okimomo, the restaurant was surprisingly empty and we were able to have our order taken instantly. The menu was slightly difficult to navigate as it had a poor layout and a large variety of menu options. My order consisted of a purple rice bowl with cabbage and egg along with an order of crispy fried tofu with green onions. </p><p><br /></p><p>After ordering, I found a place to sit. It was not difficult to find a seating location, as the restaurant was mostly empty and all of the tables seemed very clean. However, the floor definitely looked like it could have been sweeped. While waiting for our food, an appetizing smell began to emanate from the kitchen. The aroma was particularly intense because Okimomo's restaurant layout consists of an open kitchen, allowing us to watch and smell our food being cooked. The kitchen was clean and organized. </p><p><br /></p><p>Our food was delivered to our table within 10 minutes of ordering it. Once it arrived, it was too hot to eat, indicating that it was freshly made. The crispy tofu had a pleasant appearance and crispy texture, but tasted somewhat bland. It seemed like it could have used more salt. This problem was easily solved by adding Okimomo's Spicy Momo Sauce. The Momo sauce tasted somewhat like spicy mayonnaise, but had a hint of onion and soy. Similar to the crispy tofu, the purple rice was also somewhat bland, but this was also fixed with the spicy Momo sauce. I also tried add Okimomo's ginger soy sauce to the rice, but the ginger soy sauce was too sweet and had too much citrus flavor to properly compliment the purple rice dish. </p></body></html>
