I happen to visit Subway on my way back from class. Subway in CalPoly happens to be between Kennedy Library and Dexter Lawn, centrally located and is easy to spot. Subway at CalPoly is open 24 hours a day and is generally flooded with students and faculty during lunch time and in evenings.<br /></p><p>Subway is a great restaurant for students as it provides cheap, quick and healthy food. The sandwiches come in a size of 6-inch or 12-inch(or as they call it foot-long), there are various options of breads, vegetables and sauces. I ordered a Roasted Chicken sandwich with various vegetables and sauces, but I found the sandwich to be very bland. It costed me roughly 5 dollars.  I strongly feel that the person ordering the sandwich really needs to know the sauces he is putting in his sandwich as this is one part which can change the taste of the sandwich as a whole. In my case, by mistake i had asked the waiter to put sweet onion sauce which made my sandwich too sweet to eat. <br /></p><p>Service at Subway in CalPoly is someone can never complaint of, the fastest service in a restaurant I have seen till date. There were more than 10 people ahead of me in the queue when I entered and I got my turn to order in less than 5 minutes. To me this is Subway's unique selling point(USP). The staff at Subway was also very supportive they made sure to cross check about each topping they placed in the sandwich before hand, the cash counter was also well attended.<br /></p><p>The only drawback I believe the Subway at CalPoly has is SPACE. It gets too much claustrophobic if too many people are inside the restaurant, which is the case everyday during lunch hours. I would suggest them to have multiple counters during peak hours and also some extra tables such as people can sit and have their food inside. Subway as an overall is a nice place to eat and I would recommend it to fellow students.<br /></p><p></p><p></p></body></html>
