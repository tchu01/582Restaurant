They are a "build-your-own" poke restaurant. They had a distinctly Japanese vibe going on which is weird considering that poke is originally a hawaiian dish.</p><p><br /></p><p>The venue is not great. The inside is small and only offers bar style seating at a wooden plank about 1 foot in depth facing a wall. Not ideal for eating in a group. The outdoor seating is also subpar. The tables are at most 2 feet in diameter which can accommodate 3 people but is not ideal. This place would be good for two people, and works for three people. However, I would not recommend this place if your party is larger than three.</p><p><br /></p><p>The food is ok. The rice was served cold with no option for it to be hot. The rice  also promptly stuck to the cardboard boxes it was served in. They do boast a wide selection of toppings to combine. For base protein you are able to choose between five different types of fish and one type of chicken. The extras range from kimchi to seaweed salad to corn. Although it is nice to have a large selection, not a lot of it went together nicely. The kimchi and salmon did not taste great together. For $15 this place is maybe worth checking out once if you like poke.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall this place is a good idea with poor execution. At $15 you can find much high quality fish with nicer seating elsewhere. The ability to customize your dish and "trendy japanese" feel does not make up for the lack of a high quality core product.</p></body></html>
