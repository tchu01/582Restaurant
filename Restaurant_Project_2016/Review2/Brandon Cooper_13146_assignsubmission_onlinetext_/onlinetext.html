The food at Black Sheep Bar and Grill will typically cost $10 to $12, so it isn't the cheapest bar and grill in town, but the quality of the food and the drink choices make up for the cost. I ordered the Mac Daddy mac'n'cheese and wasn't expecting much more than the typical pub grub, but I was impressed at how good the food was. I would definitely rate this is some of the best macaroni and cheese that I have ever eaten.</p><p><br /></p><p>Being a bar, the staff is very quick to serve drinks and reasonably quick at serving food. The bar and grill were kept clean, which was a pleasant surprise for a fairly busy bar.</p><p><br /></p><p>Black Sheep doesn't have its own parking, being in downtown San Luis Obispo, however it is less than a block away from one of the parking structures, so there is plenty of parking available. Better yet, if you can get in and out within an hour, the parking is free. The inside is a typical bar setting, but at least before it converts to a full bar, it is kept very clean.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, I was impressed with my experience at the Black Sheep Bar and Grill. I walked in expecting okay food, and was pleasantly surprised with some of the best mac'n'cheese that I have ever eaten, along with plenty of choices for beers on tap. The venue is a pretty typical noisy bar setting, but if you can stand this, the Black Sheep is a great bar and grill to stop at for a casual dinner with drinks.</p></body></html>
