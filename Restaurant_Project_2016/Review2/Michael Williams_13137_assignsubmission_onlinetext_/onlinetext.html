However, what really makes Black Sheep stand out is their special mac and cheese. This isn't any ordinary mac and cheese, this is mac and cheese that has been upgraded. At Black Sheep two of their most popular mac and cheeses include their Beefy Mac, made with barbeque tri-tip, and their Cowboy Mac, made with buffalo chicken. On top of that you can also build your own mac and cheese. The mac and cheese at Black Sheep is by far the best mac and cheese I've ever had and you really can't go wrong with any of their options.<br /><br />Service at Black Sheep Bar and Grill is very casual which works well for the casual atmosphere, not so much if you want to interact with your waitress. Getting your order in and getting your food is typically a pretty painless process. After that you really need to work to stay in contact with your waiter.Â  Need more water? Expect to wait. Need a box? Expect to wait. Need the check? Expect to wait. At Black Sheep it really seems like the waitress is a bit overworked and could use some help.<br /><br />Black Sheep is located in downtown San Luis Obispo across the street from Pluto's. It is within walking distance from the parking structure which makes it easy to get to both by foot and by car. The restaurant itself is pretty average and typical of a bar. There isn't a ton of table seating and if it gets busy it might be hard to find a table. It is clean and has a good, casual aesthetic about it. Its a nice place to be and manages to carry that lively bar feel without being too overwhelming if you just want to grab a bite to eat.<br /><br />Overall Black Sheep Bar and Grill is a fairly nice restaurant on it's own. What really make it stand out and a notable place for me is simply their mac and cheese. How good that dish is really just elevates the entire restaurant from just another decent bar to a fantastic place I would love to go to. If anything I would highly recommend going their just for their mac and cheese. While it may not be the cheapest mac and cheese, running about $15 for some mac and cheese with a side of fries, it is more than worth it.<br /></p></body></html>
