Woodstock's Pizza is basically a restaurant which is famous for its pizza and it is right in the middle of downtown so it is kind off busy throughout the day. finally I visited this place with 2 of my cousin’s late afternoon a few days back, since I heard a lot about this place I suggested them this place. But hey, on entering I saw the place was kind of empty with only handful number of people sitting, I thought the place was famous! When I was trying to place an order I found the person at the counter a bit rude, he did not respond to the greetings nor was polite. He seemed to be quite in hurry. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and it was expensive, we landed up paying around 27 dollars. But since we were hungry and the reviews were good we felt that pizza would be good. <br /></p><p>At Woodstock’s after ordering the pizza, we noticed that all the tables were dirty and no one was cleaning the tables even, we had a hard time finding a clean and balanced table. Since all of us were returning from the beach we all used the washrooms at Woodstock’s, they too were dirty, looked like someone had a party and forgot to clean the washrooms. We waited for roughly 30 min after ordering still the pizza was nowhere to be seen, so we decided to go to the counter and check. Post our enquiry the pizza was delivered to our table by a girl 'with an attitude'. She did not smile nor responded to our question like where can we get the chili flakes, she just pointed the fingers at the other counter. We fetched the cheese and chili flakes by ourselves, which wasn't expected from a restaurant with such high ratings.</p><p>Now was the turn of pizza, to my surprise the pizza was not very hot which I was expecting and when we went picked up the pizza slice the cheese and pepperoni slipped off like water. So we were left with clumps of cheese and bread. But we were so hungry by that time, that we did not felt the need to argue with the staff. Though the pizza was OK to eat the bread was kind of dry towards the corners which all us landed up leaving in our plate.</p><p>A really sad experience for me and my cousins at Woodstock’s pizza, I am sure I will not be coming back to this place in near future at least. I will also not recommend my friends to this place as I believe the ratings are tweaked on various review websites. Not to forget finding a parking near Woodstock is a pain, we parked our car like 10 minutes’ walk from the restaurant, so one should keep that in mind as well before going there.</p></body></html>
