They are located</p><p>right next to Boba Stop in the little corner area right off the California </p><p>exit as you are headed south on 101. The place is very small with just a few</p><p>indoor tables and a few outdoor tables as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>Upon entering, all the staff were very friendly and greeted me with a smile.</p><p>They then asked if it was my first time (which it was) and informed me how</p><p>their ordreing system words. The options are varying size bowls or a wrap</p><p>which I though was interesting for an asian-fusion restaurant. The next step is</p><p>to pick all the items that you are interested in and they add them together for</p><p>you.</p><p><br /></p><p>I order a small bowl, since I had never tried poke before with a brown rice for</p><p>the base. I went with the salmon and spicy tuna. For vegetables I added carrots</p><p>and edamame. I then tried the spicy wasabi sauce which was very good and had</p><p>them add that as well. My other toppings included seaweed salad and pickled</p><p>ginger. The staff was friendly and willing to make suggestions and what</p><p>pair better with certain things so you don't end up with a bowl of conflicting</p><p>flavors.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the end, I thought the fish was fresh and tender, which was probably the</p><p>most important part to me. Everything ended up tasting good together. The price</p><p>was $10 for a small bowl which is kinda pricey, but worth the fresh healthy</p><p>ingredients. </p><p><br /></p></body></html>
