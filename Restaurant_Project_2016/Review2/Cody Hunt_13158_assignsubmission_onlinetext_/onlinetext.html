It sells pizzeria-style food, including pizza, pasta, and calzones. It also serves beer and wine. The food quality, is, in general, just okay. It is not particularly good, although it is not awful either. It is, however, a bit expensive, especially considering the quality and amount of the servings.</p><p>The service is not great. Requesting a slice of pizza already made is simple and quick enough, but anything that must be specially made often takes a long time to be served. Additionally, the orders may be incorrect. One member of my party received the wrong type of calzone after waiting twenty minutes.</p><p>The venue is about what is expected for a pizzeria. It is located adjacent to Mustang Lanes bowling alley and arcade, for those looking for additional activities with dinner. The tables and other equipment are not high quality, and the decor is somewhat lacking.</p><p>Overall, Mustang Station is not a very good restaurant. It is better than nothing, and it is the only place that serves alcohol on Cal Poly campus, but hungry readers should try to seek other options if available.Â </p></body></html>
