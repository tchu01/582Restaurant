I did not have any trouble with parking but on a busy day, I can see how it might prove difficult to find parking. It is right off of Los Osos Valley Road and there are many other places nearby such as Grocery Outlet, so you can do some shopping after having lunch or dinner. I would definitely come back and eat here again with some of my family or friends and I would recommend this place for people who have not yet tried it.</p></body></html>
