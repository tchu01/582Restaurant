From waking up I was in a hustle. No time to even give my stomach a passing glance, let alone satisfy it. But at that moment of down time it screeched at me louder than I could bare. Again I was on the move, looking for something to quiet the demon in my  belly. Darting through an unassuming shopping center I found what would shut my gut up for good and the only place open at  such an early hour -- Freshh Donuts. <br /><br />Walking inside I found a chinese woman watching a soap opera behind the counter, immediately jolting to attention asking, “You want breakfast?” Yes, yes I did. I took my time to look over the donuts in the curved glass counter and the printed out pictures of their egg and bagel sandwiches just below the menu stuck to the wall above the counter. I ordered a large coffee, cinnamon roll, and an egg and cheese bagel sandwich, coming out to only $6.32. <br /><br />I sat down at a small table to finally take in my surroundings. The entire place looked like it hadn’t changed a bit since the early eighties: brown tile floor, square burgundy tables with seats attached, and an orange countertop covered in plastic laminate so real you couldn’t tell the difference. It doesn’t need to be modern or stylish though. It’s functional. It’s the sort of place working-class joes go when they didn’t have time to make something at home. There wasn’t a hipster on their laptop in site. I slowly ate my cinnamon roll waiting for my sandwich. It was a bit dry, as if it had been sitting in the case for a while, but still satisfying. <br /><br />After no more than seven minutes my egg and cheese sandwich came out of the back kitchen. With the first bite I could taste the cheap cheese they used mix with the still moist egg, all pinned between the two halves of the bagel. Each bite, savory and slightly sweet, took away bits and pieces of my hunger, occasionally interrupted by a sip of it’ll-do coffee. The entire experience was sub-par but ultimately extremely satisfying. I didn’t want to be impressed. I just wanted something to eat, and something that didn’t kill my wallet in the process, and Freshh Donuts did just that. I left feeling ready to get to the work I had to do, no longer having to worry about the banshee below being mad at me.<br /></p></body></html>
