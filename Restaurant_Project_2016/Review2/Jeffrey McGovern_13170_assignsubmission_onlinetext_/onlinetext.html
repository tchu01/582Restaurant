I ordered the Meatball Calzone, but was mistakenly presented with an Italian Calzone. Imagine a plate sized piece of pie dough filled with Gallo salami, soggy olives, something cheese-like, I think peppers, and two cups of oil and grease. Then, smother it in canned marinara that was opened at the beginning of the week, cover it in a more recognizable cheese substance, and throw it in a little conveyer belt oven to let it all mush together a bit more. Finally, serve it in a to-go tin that's too small for it, and give it to the customer about fifteen to twenty minutes after they ordered it, ensuring that it's an altogether different item than what they ordered. The bread to insides ratio is far too high, which doesn't work well when the bread is dry. The ingredients tastes cheap, shoddy, and possibly old, though it is reasonably filling. For $6.95, it's probably a decent price for something filling, but it isn't anything that's worth going back to. They have a decent selection of beer, including staples like Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA and selections from Firestone, Deschutes, and Saint Archer, among others, with pricing that is the standard going rate for beer downtown at $7 or less.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">As mentioned above, the service at Mustang Station was unfortunate. First, it took about 15-20 minutes for them to realize that I had a calzone waiting (because god forbid they have to actually make something instead of just serve a already cooked hot plated version) and when they finally remembered that I had an Italian Calzone waiting (even though I'd ordered a Meatball). Once the server mentioned the wrong type, I quickly decided that I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for them to mess up my order, but wanted to make sure that I wasn't getting someone else's Calzone. They assured me that there weren't any other meatball calzones and that the price was the same. I received the wrong calzone in a very awkward to-go tin, reminding me that nearly all of their customers are freshmen who don't have time to understand the consequences of what they eat or pay for.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Mustang Station's venue was recently updated to a fairly modern decor. Fresh chalkboard that has yet to be mired by years or months of revisions to the menu has been painted onto the walls and a brand spankin' new logo for their third name in 8 years hangs above the entrance and is painted on one of the chalk walls inside. There is a lot of space to pack many students into it without feeling cramped and the high ceilings help with that. The furniture must have been recently updated, too, to include some giant fluffy black leather couches, in addition to the standard square tables with four chairs. I am so glad that the Cal Poly Corporation invests so much into their student body's health and education.</p><p style="margin:0px 0px 10px;">Mustang Station is yet another appendage of the Campus Dining monster grown and engineered for the Cal Poly freshman class and any professors unfortunate enough to feel the need to eat at. It's a staff of students, for students, run by a corporation uninterested in the student experience. My freshman year was the last time I ate a calzone from this building and I wish I had kept it that way. My calzone-eating experience today was nearly identical to the last time I remember. After a careful review of this commonly accessible on-campus food place, it's no wonder Cal Poly comes under regular criticism for their poor food options and quality.</p></div></div><br /><p></p></body></html>
