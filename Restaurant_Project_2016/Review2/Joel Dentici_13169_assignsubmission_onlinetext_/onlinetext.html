This is a burger that comes with a 1/3-1 pound patty, cheese, bacon, avocado, a fried egg, and possibly the works (including Sylvester's sauce which is probably just 1000 islands). I thought an egg on a burger sounded weird when I first got this, but it was delicious and I make them at home all the time now. I also ordered a chocolate milkshake which was amazing.</p><p>The service we received was adequate. It wasn't fast or slow. Unfortunately they only have one cash register, so it is slow ordering with big groups. The food comes out very quickly after ordering.</p><p>The venue is pretty nice. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a sink by the outside seating so you can wash all the grease off yourself after eating.</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere and food at Sylvester's. I have now visited this place many times and it never disappoints.</p></body></html>
