The food was delicious and had a wide variety of fresh ingredients. Although I am not a fan of salads, I enjoyed the freedom to pick out what I wanted inside my salad. In addition, the price was a modest eight dollars but the portioning was still a lot. One issue I had with the food was that the side of mashed potatoes was not hot enough.Â </p><p>This restaurant has a pretty hands off approach to service. Besides the workers who prepare the food as you walk along their food stations and the cashier, there is no other interactions. I simply got my food and found a table to sit at, which gave me a sort of cafeteria dining feel. Although this may not be a bad approach, I am more accustomed to having someone seat me.</p><p>The venue was very modern and well lit. There were enough tables to accomodate different party sizes and to seat customers even during busy hours. One cool aspect was that the food preparation was done in front of you as you walked through their food stations. You simply pointed at what you wanted, and the servers added it to your order. One suggestion could be to move the food stations farther to the back to avoid having waiting customers waiting around the eating customers.</p><p>Overall, the restaurant provided a pleasant dining experience with a great price and quality. Although I tend to dislike salads, Pluto's did a decent job of convincing me that I should give salads more thought. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a light but filling meal.</p></body></html>
