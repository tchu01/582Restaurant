To order food you tell the cashier want you want and they bring it out. The food was awesome! I got the Raku Ramen bowl which had fried chicken, an egg and noodles in a spicy broth. I was very content with the taste and I got to add to the spice by adding some chipotle mayo and Sriracha sauce.  </p><p>The service was good. Our food came out promptly but the cashier seemed like she was trying to rush our group in ordering our food. <br /></p><p>The venue was sufficient. It had many tables (inside and outside). The lighting inside was kind of harshly bright by cashier, but ominously dark on the other side of the room. We decided to just do take out as there were many people there.<br /></p><p>Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Raku Ramen. Most importantly, the food was tasty. The service and venue were not as great, but if you’re looking for some tasty ramen / noodles, it’ll be worth it. The restaurant is right next to Jaffa Café and Taqueria Santa Cruz if you’re with a group that wants a variety of food. <br /></p><p><br /></p></body></html>
