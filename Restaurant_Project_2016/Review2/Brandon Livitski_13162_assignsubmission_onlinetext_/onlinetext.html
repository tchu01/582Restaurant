I ordered the Caribbean Chicken bowl which not only was $6 total, but was very tasty! It's not easy to find food that good for that cheap.</p><p>As you don't have a waiter at Tiki Hut (you just order at the counter) I will instead evaluate the service based on wait time for my food. With this in mind the speed was somewhat lacking. Being one of two people there at the time, the wait seemed unusually long.</p><p>I thought the venue was actually pretty well suited for the place. The decor definitely gave the tiki/island feel and as it's not a sit down restaurant I don't feel like you could ask for much more.</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed Tiki Hut and will likely make it a frequent place I stop for lunch. As I said, the quality of the food for the price is pretty close to unbeatable, and the place claims to be healthy (though i'm not sure how much I would agree with that).</p></body></html>
