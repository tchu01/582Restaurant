Parking is easy to find relative to other downtown restaurants - there is a parking lot behind, spaces on the street in front, and residential parking space beyond the parking lot. I ordered a Chicken Shwarma Wrap and tried stuffed grape leaves. The chicken shwarma wasn't terrible. There was a fair amount of meat, but it was relatively flavorless. There was little else in the wrap other than the meat - some lettuce and tomato. I disliked the stuffed grape leaves because the wrapping (grape leaf) was so sour that it overpowered what was inside. Overall other Mediterranean restaurants in the area such as Petra are far better for comparable cost.</p><p><br /></p><p>The service was good. The customer fills out a form to order, but the staff were very friendly and were there to help and answer questions. When the food is prepared, the customer's name is called out. I docked a point just becuase I think this whole setup is atypical for the size and cost of the restaurant. Also, the aforementioned Petra serves food and doesn't bother with a form. I didn't personally find Jaffa's system bad, but I didn't think it quite fit and it is not clear what to do on entrance.</p><p><br /></p><p>The venue was fine. The restaurant had adequate space, good tables, and good seating. Parking was also easy to find even though it is technically downtown.</p><p><br /></p><p>In terms of food, I don't prefer Jaffa. There was a lack of variety and flavor in the Shwarma wrap. The staff was prompt and friendly and the venue is good, but neither of these can make up for food that is subpar. It isn't a bad restaurant, but it is not one I would frequent simply because I don't like the food.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
