Each of these dishes costs about twelve dollars, although the seafood dishes tend to be a little more expensive. Thai Boat was conveniently located within walking distance from my apartment, so we did not need to look for a parking space. However, there were plenty of spaces available, as the nearby businesses were not open during dinner time. Prior to this visit, I had attempted to eat at Thai Boat on a weekend, only to be disappointed that it was only open during weekdays.</p><p><br /></p><p>When we arrived at Thai Boat, the restaurant seemed slightly crowded. However, we were able to claim the last available indoor table. We were pleasantly greeted from behind the cash register by a man waiting to take our order. The resaurant had a pleasant aroma of curries and fried rice. The menu had quite a few options, but was well-organized into different types of dishes such as rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, curries, etc. I opted for the pineapple fried rice with chicken, while one of my friends ordered the bean noodles with chicken. Our food was brought to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. </p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, my pineapple fried rice with chicken was very good. The rice contained a nice variety of well-seasoned ingredients, including carrots, green onions, cashews, pineapple, and rice. However, it seemed that the chicken was relatively bland compared to the surrounding ingredients. I had an initial fear that my fried rice would be too sweet because of the pineapple, but the pineapple turned out to be the perfect sweetness for such a dish. The dish also seemed to be perfectly salted, greatly enhancing its flavor. Unfortunately, though the dish was not spicy enough. When our order was taken, I should have asked for them to make it spicier.</p><p><br /></p><p>I was also able to try my friend's bean noodles with chicken. The dish had chicken, bean noodles, tomatoes, onions, carrots, and some sort of spicy sauce. The bean noodles were transparent and looked very similar to noodles I had tried before. Upon tasting these noodles, it was clear that they were different than normal noodles. The noodles themselves tasted like beans, complimenting the rest of the dish. It seems that the bean noodles were an important part of the dish, as without them, the dish would likely have been bland. </p><p><br /></p><p>Another of my friends ordered a curry and ended up being unable to finish it. When she asked for a to-go box, the staff also gave her some free rice to go with her curry. </p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, from my first impression, Thai Boat seems to be the best Thai restaurant in San Luis Obispo, although it is slightly more expensive than some of the cheaper Thai restaurants around town.</p><p><br /></p></body></html>
