I decided to order a small Smoked Brisket Chili and a Brown Nitro beer, both items I would never consider for my sensitive stomach and beer apathy. The order they placed in front of me was surprisingly true to the definition of "small": a shallow casserole dish the size of my hand and two dainty cornbread bites where if I squinted hard enough, they could possibly pass for the size of marshmallows. In addition, the 16 ounce beer came in a glass that seemed suspiciously smaller than the usual pint glass. The chili tasted alright and the cornbread was nothing spectacular, although I wish I got more than two gumdrops worth of it to sample. The brown beer was fine, but since it seems that I don't care much for beer, I gave half of it away. Overall, I am sad I spent $16 on a small dish and drink I knew I wasn't going to like.</p><p>As expected, the tavern wasn't too packed for a Wednesday afternoon. We didn't have to wait long to be seated and taken care of. The staff was friendly, but they neglected to fill my glass of water; maybe it's because they saw I had a glass of beer and didn't need more fluids.</p><p>As with all the new overpriced sports bars popping up around town, I appreciate the open, clean, and sophisticated feel of the venue. I also like how it's so close to campus and just a block away from my apartment so if I spontaneously feel like spending more money than I should, I can just walk across the street instead of driving downtown.</p><p>In total, Milestone Tavern wasn't overwhelmingly astounding, but I would visit again due to its convenient location. I'm sure next time, if I order something I know I'll like, it'll be more worth the money.</p></body></html>
