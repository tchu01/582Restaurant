Parking is a hassle because there are a limited number of parking spots near the restaurant, so one can get lucky or you'll need to park in the parking garage. The restaurant is pretty spacious inside with plenty of tables to sit down many groups, and it's filled with aviation themed decor like the walls and tables have airplanes painted on them. I guess it fits the idea of wings because planes have wings. There are no napkins instead they have a giant paper towel roll that the whole place shares. The bathroom was pretty confusing to find because it's hidden in the back of the restaurant after going through a long corridor that feels like an exit.<br /></p><p>The food was mediocre at best. I ordered an eight piece combo of boneless lemon pepper and garlic parmesan wings with fries and a small drink. The wings were split evenly between the two flavors, so four lemon pepper wings and four garlic parmesan wings. The garlic parmesan wings were literally drowned in parmesan cheese. I had to dig through the pile of cheese to find the wings, which weren't the biggest either, and because of that the flavor was overwhelming for my taste buds. Although, the lemon pepper wings tasted a bit better than the others, some of those wings tasted bland like if they didn't have a flavor. The fries came in one large size, which can be pretty filling, and they seemed to be seasoned with sugar or something because of the sweet taste they had. The total cost was about $11 and the whole meal was very filling, but not worth the quality of the food.<br /></p><p>The service was pretty good. The employees who all looked like college kids were super friendly and easy to hold a conversation with. They were also nice enough to explain the combos and recommend flavors to newbies. It took about 15 minutes at most for the food to come out, which isn't terribly bad. They do have the option to phone-in the order to either pick-up or to arrive and start eating. They operate until midnight which is pretty late compared to all the other restaurants in San Luis Obispo.Â <br /></p><p>Overall, Wingstop is alright if one is craving wings. It does take some time to get there because of its location downtown and due to limited parking. The wings aren't the best but the amount of food given will fill you up. It's a restaurant but at the same time it almost feels like a fast food place because of the quality of the food. The service was friendly and there are plenty of seats available to sit down and eat.<br /></p></body></html>
