Though a relatively new establishment, the owners have been restaurant owners in the area for several years, operating the popular sushi and seafood restaurant Kai Lana. Kochi boasts of being the only restaurant in town where you can cook food at your table, including various meat and fish options, as well as shabu-shabu (a.k.a. hotpot). Although Kochi has been surrounded with a fair amount of hype, I found it to be a relatively disappointing experience. </p><p>The quality of the food was the primary factor that led to my overall disappointment with Kochi. Our server brought us seven small (probably 1/4 cup each) appetizers—white fish, rice noodles and bell peppers, potato salad, kimchi, seaweed salad, bean sprout slaw, and white rice. I was pleasantly surprised by the wide assortment of things to try and the fact that we could get unlimited refills of any of them sounded very generous; however, I really only liked the white fish dish and the bean sprout slaw was okay. Asian food is my favorite type of cuisine, which is why I was surprised that most of the other complimentary side dishes were not worth eating more than a taste of. Even the quality of the white rice was well below what one would expect from an Asian restaurant. For my entree, I ordered Dumpling Ricecake Soup for $14. It came in a large bowl with about six meat-and-veggie-filled dumplings, a generous helping of rice cakes, enokitake (thin white mushrooms), a little bit of rice noodles, as well as a couple other ingredients all in a soup broth that tasted like some sort of chicken broth. Though the food was good, I felt that it was very overpriced for what I got—most of the meal was some dough/rice product and water. I also felt that they put an unnecessary number of rice cakes in the soup (there must have been forty or fifty slices!), but that didn’t hurt anything. I didn’t leave the restaurant hungry, but the dissatisfying appetizers and the overpriced entree left me regretting not spending my money elsewhere. <br /></p><p>Our waitress at Kochi seemed fairly inexperienced and awkward, but we appreciated her friendly and mostly prompt service. From what I saw, the other waiters seemed to be knowledgable and pleasant as well. However, towards the end of our meal when we had finished eating, we must have waited ten minutes for our waitress to drop off the check before I interrupted another waiter passing by who then brought us our check. We thought that maybe our waitress had left the restaurant, but after our payment was processed, she walked past our table and dropped off our card without saying anything. We thought this was strange and we wished she would have checked in with us more than once throughout the meal. For these reasons, I would say that the service at Kochi definitely has room to improve. <br /></p><p>Kochi’s best attribute was the venue itself. The entrance, tables, chairs, walls, etc. all appeared to be high quality and elegant design choices. Part of this is likely due to the fact that the restaurant has only been in operation a few months. The aesthetics and environment of the restaurant are conducive to casual dates or family dining, though I would not be too surprised if it was chosen for a slightly more formal occasion. Overall, I was disappointed with Kochi’s overpriced food and subpar service, though they did have a tasteful interior. <br /></p></body></html>
