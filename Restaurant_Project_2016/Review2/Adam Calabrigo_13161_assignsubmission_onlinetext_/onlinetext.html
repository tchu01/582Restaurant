El Matador features a cozy, clean interior. The centerpiece, a grandiose oak bar, displays an impressive selection of wine and beer. Plentiful wall decorations create a warm atmosphere. The restaurant has no dedicated parking, but street parking is available and multiple parking garages are located close by. The employees speak English with customers but mostly Spanish amongst themselves.</p><p>El Matador certainly has one thing going for it: generous portion sizes at reasonable prices. A chip and salsa station keeps guests occupied until food is served. The chips were pleasant, featuring a slight seasoning, and the salsa tasted fresh. These items are self-serve in the form of a small bar, so feel free to help yourself to however much you would like. As for the meal, this reviewer ordered a beef burrito and a chicken enchilada, which came with beans and rice. The rice could have used more seasoning but had fluffy texture - no overcooked grains here. The pinto beans were cooked nicely as well. The chicken enchilada, with red sauce, defied expectations. El Matador's red sauce lacks the sweetness of many red sauces; rather, this sauce carries respectable heat and is subtly spiced. The burrito contained shredded beef, rice, and beans. The beef, like the chicken,Â  could have been seasoned more. The tortilla had pleasant texture and good mouth feel. While a bit bland, the plate offered a filling meal for only 12.00. Notably, El Matador offers an impressive selection of craft beers (for a Mexican restaurant at least), so beer lovers may find this a good pick for Mexican food.</p><p>El Matador offers a large selection of standard Mexican fair, including burritos, tacos, fajitas, and many more. Conveniently, the items are available in combination plates, meaning customers need not settle for one item. This allows for may potential variants. El Matador is not quite a sit-down restaurant; rather, customers place their orders at a register next to the bar and wait for the food to be brought out. Water is available for free via a cooler on the bar. These elements combine to give El Matador a casual vibe. Additionally, bins are located on top of trash cans, encouraging customers to bus their own tables. I did, but many customers simply left their plates on the table as they left.</p><p>El Matador is a relatively new restaurant in town. As such, the employees were extremely friendly, inviting me to check out the menu and ask questions. The employee who took my order greeted me as I entered the restaurant. After my food was delivered (in a reasonable amount of time), the employee involvement was minimal. They left me to myself for the duration of the meal, which I appreciated given the casual feel of the restaurant. Those expecting more involved wait staff might find themselves wanting more. Overall, El Matador provides a casual environment with friendly staff and good value for the money. The beer and wine selection is a big positive for a college town.<br /></p></body></html>
