We were mostly looking for a cheap place to finish the day, Taco De Mexico easily fulfilled this requirement. i got an unusual burrito called Chile Releno and inside of the burrito was half of a poblano pepper stuffed wtih cheese! i do a lot of cooking at home with poblanos, so the familiar taste was exciting. It tasted great, although the burrito was a little smaller than that of more American-Mexican establishments such as Chipotle. <br /><br />The service itself was simple. The lady at the counter was friendly and helped walk me through the menu. Many of the other customers seemed like they were frequent and there were a few smiles pointed in our direction as we tried to analyze our options. The food was prepared and served to us quickly.<br /><br />Taco De Mexico's venue is rather small and not really intended for a long duration meal. However, it wasn't uncomfortable and it was about what you'd expect for a smaller Mexican restraunt like this. However, it probably would be very loud during peak hours and it is not the most romantic setting for date night. On the other hand, it's a very short walk from downtown which is convienent. <br /><br />Overall, Taco De Mexico's excellent taste for an excellent price makes it a top choice for future day trips to Morro Bay. My partner and i will likely return. There was also a mural that could be easily viewed on the location, and that was nice.<br /></p></body></html>
