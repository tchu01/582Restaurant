The selection is mostly what you would expect from a brunch establishment, though I was pleasantly surprised to find a good selection of vegetarian options. My wife and I both ordered omelettes, as well as a stack of pancakes to share with our son. As I was recovering from a cold, I didn't add any spicy condiments to the omelette, yet it was still very flavorful; the included O'Brien potatoes were delicious as well. The food was saltier than I would have liked, as I found myself reaching for a glass of water quite often. The pancakes' flavor was somewhat underwhelming, unhelped by the nondescript bottle of syrup that the menu claimed to be maple.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">The staff was responsive and enthusiastic. When we first arrived to a line of people at the door, we thought about going elsewhere. However, since we could fit at a small table, the owner seated us immediately. Our waitress was quick to come by with coffee and to take our order - perhaps being seated near the kitchen helped.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">Given its location on the Morro Bay waterfront, the venue was a bit disappointing. No part of the dining area overlooked the bay and, although we had a window seat, we could only see a parking lot. The interior was clean and otherwise not noteworthy.</span></p><br /><span style="vertical-align:baseline;">Although we have lived in Morro Bay for two years, we have never been to The Coffee Pot because its operating hours do not match that of when we typically eat out. Despite the fact that it would require some planning on our part to ensure we were at the docks by noon, the menu appears varied enough that I would like to go back. However, the prices, while standard for the area, are high enough to prevent me from going regularly.</span><br /></body></html>
