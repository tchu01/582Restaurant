Their menu has fairly typical brewery foods like various appetizers, specialty pizzas, burgers, soup/salad, and, of course, plenty of BEER! </p><p>After walking in, we were greeted warmly and given the option of sitting inside, out front, or out back. We settled for out back and I’m glad we did because we loved it out there! The inside had a cool modern look with some huge TVs, but there was some great weather and we sat at a wooden table surrounded by other wooden furniture, brick walls, heating lamps, and umbrellas. It was also situated right on the little river that runs through downtown which was nice. </p><p>Service was pretty dang good the whole time as the waitress was very sociable. We ordered drinks and dinner all at once and then waited only about 20 or so minutes total for our food to arrive (got an appetizer after 10). The appetizer we got was lamb/chicken nachos which were super bomb… I’m not sure I’ve had better nachos. Munching down on those got me very excited for the main meal, but this is actually where I got somewhat disappointed. I ordered the chicken and waffles, which I had only ever had once before, and the presentation of the food when it came even looked absolutely amazing, but the end result just didn’t taste too good… The waffles were extremely dry, almost to the point that I couldn’t eat them without taking a shlug of my beer. The chicken came out nicely, but I didn’t realize that it would be chicken WINGS (bone and all), which made the meal actually very difficult to eat. I expected to be able to eat chicken and waffles together, but I ended up having to eat them separately because of the bones. The gravy tasted alright, though there could have been more of it. A friend of mine mentioned that I should say something about the dish to have them take it back, and maybe I should have, but I’m just not one to normally send back food.</p><p>The beer, however, was awesome there (as it should be, for a brewery, I suppose!) I asked for a Cali-Weiss beer, which is their version of a wheat beer, mixed with coke and the waitress was surprised yet supportive. My drink actually came with a little speck or something in it, and the waitress offered to get a new one, but it wasn’t a big deal. The prices did have me pretty upset by the end, though. With a beer, coke, meal, appetizer, tax, and tip, I ended up paying around $33 for my meal! It’s rare that I spend that much on a meal, and I wasn’t happy having paid it for the quality that I got. But, all in all, SLO Brew is a very classy place and I would definitely recommend it. I’m willing to believe that I caught their chef on a bad day, or maybe some dishes are just better than others there. One can always rely on the beer, at least. </p><p><br /></p></body></html>
