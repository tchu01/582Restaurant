They offer a Taco Tuesday and Taco Wednesday special where you can buy tacos for a dollar each. Their burrito offers are also very well priced at $9 dollars for what felt like a pound and half burrito.</p><p><br /></p><p>The seating options are quite nice. The inside seating options are pretty basic, offering booth style 4 person tables. However, the outside is something special. They have a wide array of succulents which are a visual treat. The pots the succulents are housed in are also quality aswell which is a nice touch. Also depending where you sit you are offered a nice view of Bishop's peak.</p><p><br /></p><p>The service is not great. The cashier unapologetically quoted me three different prices for my tacos. This was after we had to wait seven minutes for them to restock the receipt paper. Which you would hope would be stocked around dinner time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall this restaurant is a classic example standard Mexican food where you are sure to get your moneys worth. I give it 4/5 overall because the outdoor seating is so nice.</p></body></html>
