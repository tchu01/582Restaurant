I ordered the gaucho nachos which were a tad pricey at $14 for nachos, but the portion was decent and the quality of the food well made up for it. Their drink menu was a tad pricey as well at around $8 for a beer.</p><p>Our service at Fish Gaucho was a lot better than anticipated; going in the place was completely packed and we barely found two seats left in the bar area. None the less, we had our orders taken promptly and would not have been able to tell how busy they were. Additionally, the tap for the beer I ordered ran out mid-pour and to make it up to me they brought out an extra free beer and a half (i was given the first half poured glass), awesome service!</p><p>The seating and tables at Fish Gaucho was a tad smaller than what I might prefer, but as I was sharing food, having only one plate kept the space manageable. As far as the atmosphere goes, the place was slightly on the loud side, but it didn't seem to bother me at all. The decor seemed relatively fitting for a somewhat modern Mexican restaurant.</p><p>Overall I really thought the place was a good choice for dinner, and would indeed go back some time when I am in the area. The food and service were highlights for me, the only thing for me is that I could easily see myself spending a fair amount there due to the prices, especially on their drinks.</p></body></html>
